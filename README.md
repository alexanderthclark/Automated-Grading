# Automated Grading

This is sample code for automating some grading steps. For full use, you'll have to put this in a loop and send the scores to some kind of grade file. 

This can be used for complete automation of multiple choice exams. 

For coding, I just provide some simple function output and make no attempt at assigning a numerical score automatically. In practice, I would just use this for quick reference when grading by hand and provide additional comments in a separate file. 

## Extensions
Use [https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/](pydrive) to send output directly and privately to a student.
